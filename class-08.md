### Domain Modeling


Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.


CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.



If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.



CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.




To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we
introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)


1. position:static
2. position:relative
3. position:absolute
4. position:fixed
5. z-index
6. float



Clearing Floats
* clear
* left
* right
* both
* none



Many web pages use multiple
columns in their design. This
is achieved by using a div
element to represent each
column. The following three CSS
properties are used to position
the columns next to each other


* width
* float
* margin



Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.



Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.


Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).



Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.




Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.



The liquid layout uses
percentages to specify the width
of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the
screen.




Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.





CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.



1. @import


Some web page authors split
up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets. For
example, they might use one
style sheet to control the layout
and another to control fonts,
colors and so on.


1. link


On this page you can see the
other technique for including
multiple style sheets. Inside the
head element is a separate
link element for each style
sheet.





* div elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
